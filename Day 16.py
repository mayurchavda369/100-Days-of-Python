# Function in Python:
# a function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. 
# Functions provide better modularity and code reusability in programming. 
# They allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
# There are Three types of Function in Python:
# 1. Built in Function
# 2. User defined Function (define by user, "def" keyword using)
# 3. Lambda or Anonymous Function. its also called as single line function.(use lambda keyward) lambda arguments: expression

# Built in function in Python.
# Python has a rich standard library that provides numerous built-in functions to perform various operations. 
# As of Python 3.10, there are over 70 built-in functions available. Some of the most commonly used built-in functions include 
# print(), len(), range(),input(), str(), int(), float(), list(), dict(), type(), sum(), max(), min(), abs(), round(),sorted(), zip(), map(), filter(), 
# reduce(), enumerate(),any(), all(), open(), format(), dir(), help(), callable(), isinstance(), issubclass(), eval(), exec(), and globals().

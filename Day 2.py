# Print is a Built in Function to dispaly anything.
# you can give any type of value in print function.
# you can using "sep"keyward for seperation in print.
# you can using "end" keyward for write anything in end of words in print.
# When you call print(object()), it essentially creates an instance of the object class (which is a generic, built-in class in Python), and 
# then the print function attempts to convert this object to its string representation and display it. 
# The string representation of an instance of the object class typically includes information about the memory location of the object.
# In the output, 0xXXXXXXXX represents the memory address where the object is stored. The exact address will vary each time you run the program.
# print() use for new line.
# we can using print function we write in file also.

# comments : some info provide to team member or some info hide to code thats why we use comment
# comment symbol is "#" and multiline comments use with ''' comments '''.

#Escape squence character :

# Backspace (\b): Represents a backspace character.


print("Hello\bWorld")

# Unicode Escape (\uXXXX or \UXXXXXXXX): Represents a Unicode character based on its hexadecimal value.

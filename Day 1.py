Introduction with Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. 
It was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
 Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with 
dynamic semantics. 
 Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic 
binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.
 Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and 
code reuse. 
 The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or 
binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
Why Python?
 Designed to be easy to learn and master
 Clean, clear syntax
 Very few keywords
 Highly portable
 Runs almost anywhere - high end servers and workstations, down to 
windows CE
 Uses machine independent byte-code
 Extensible
 Designed to be extensible using C/C++, 
 allowing access to many external libraries
Features of Python
 Clean syntax plus high-level data types
 Leads to fast coding (First language in many universities abroad!)
 Uses white-space to delimit blocks
 Humans generally do, so why not the language?
 Try it, you will end up liking it
 Variables do not need declaration
 Although not a type-less language
Python Productivity
 Reduced development time
 code is 2-10x shorter than C, C++, Java
 Improved program maintenance
 code is extremely readable
 Less training
 language is very easy to learn
OOPS in Python
 Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, 
creating and using classes and objects are downright easy.
 Overview of OOP Terminology
 Class: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that 
characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables 
and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
 Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are 
defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not 
used as frequently as instance variables are.
 Data member: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a 
class and its objects.
 Function overloading: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular 
function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments 
involved.
 Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the 
current instance of a class.
 Inheritance: The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are 
derived from it.
 Instance: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class 
Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
 Instantiation: The creation of an instance of a class.
 Method: A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.
 Object: A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object 
comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.
 Operator overloading: The assignment of more than one function to a particular 
operator.
Programming Style
 Python programs/modules are written as text files with traditionally a .py extension.
 Each Python module has its own discrete namespace.
 Name space within a Python module is a global one.
 Python modules and programs are differentiated only by the way they are called.
 .py files executed directly are programs (often referred to as scripts)
 .py files referenced via the import statement are modules.
 Thus, the same .py file can be a program/script, or a module.
